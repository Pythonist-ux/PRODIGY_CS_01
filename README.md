TASK 1 - Encrypt/Decrypt Caesar Cipher

## Caesar Cipher

This is a Python program that can encrypt and decrypt text using the Caesar Cipher algorithm. Users can input a message and a shift value to perform encryption and decryption.

## Libraries Used

The following Python libraries were used in this project:

- tkinter: This is a standard Python GUI library used for creating the user interface.
- ctypes (Windows only): This library is used to call the DwmSetWindowAttribute function from the Windows dwmapi library to set the title bar color (Windows only).


## Usage

1. Enter the text you want to encrypt or decrypt in the provided text box.
2. Enter the shift value in the entry field.
   - Shift Value - 6

4. Click the "Encrypt" button to encrypt the text or the "Decrypt" button to decrypt the text.
