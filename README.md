TASK 1- Encrypt/Decrypt Ceaser Cypher

# Caesar Cipher

This is a Python program that can encrypt and decrypt text using the Caesar Cipher algorithm. Users can input a message and a shift value to perform encryption and decryption.

## Problem Statement

Create a Python program that can encrypt and decrypt text using the Caesar Cipher algorithm. Allow users to input a message and a shift value to perform encryption and decryption.

## Libraries Used

The following Python libraries were used in this project:

- `tkinter`: This is a standard Python GUI library used for creating the user interface.
- `ctypes` (Windows only): This library is used to call the `DwmSetWindowAttribute` function from the Windows `dwmapi` library to set the title bar color (Windows only).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   https://github.com/Pythonist-ux/PRODIGY_CS_01.git

## Usage

1. Enter the text you want to encrypt or decrypt in the provided text box.
2. Enter the shift value in the entry field.
3. Click the "Encrypt" button to encrypt the text or the "Decrypt" button to decrypt the text.
4. The encrypted or decrypted text will be displayed in the text box.

## Features

- Tkinter for GUI
- AMOLED dark theme with modern colors and fonts
- Rounded corners for the text box and entry field
- Responsive and resizable window
- Input validation for the shift value
